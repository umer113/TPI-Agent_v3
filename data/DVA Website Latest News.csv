https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/veterans-business-could-be-your-community,Veterans in business - this could be your community,"During the height of the COVID pandemic, two entrepreneurial veterans, Peter Liston and Matt Moseley, founded the Veteran Community Business Chamber to raise the profile of veteran-owned businesses across Australia.
Five years and a rebrand later, the Veteran Business Community (VBC) is as committed as ever to supporting veterans and their families on their journey to self-employment through entrepreneurship.
‘Our goal is to see veteran entrepreneurship become an established transition pathway from the military,’ Peter says.
Military service equips veterans with many skills and attributes that are directly transferrable to successful business ownership.
‘Veterans have strong skills in leadership, organisation and operations – being able to project manage, forecast and look at risk. When we are looking at soft skills, it’s the drive, determination, the problem-solving, the persistence and courage,’ Peter says. ‘However, there are some significant knowledge gaps, and those gaps are sales and marketing, cashflow and accounting.
‘VBC steps in to support those gaps, helping people to understand branding and marketing, lead capture and lead generation. How to actually sell. Then it will go back to their strengths of operational delivery.’
To support veteran entrepreneurs, VBC offers quarterly business bootcamps, mentorship and networking opportunities. Peter has also started up a podcast,
Military Mind for Business
, where he’s joined by other veterans to discuss what it takes to build a successful business.
VBC is working hard to promote ‘buying veteran’ by introducing veteran-owned businesses into major industry supply chains.
They’ve secured a new partnership with Gateway by ICN to spotlight veteran-owned businesses on its platform. The Gateway connects small-to-medium enterprises to major projects and will offer greater access to large-scale corporate and government contracts. When signing up with VBC, member businesses undergo a formal registration process to identify as ‘veteran owned.’
‘Supporting veteran-owned businesses and putting veteran-owned business in your supply chain is about the quality and character and commitment of the people behind the business,’ Peter emphasises.
‘We don’t believe in preferential treatment, but we believe a veteran’s service should be a point of difference.’
In just one of many success stories, VBC connected community member
Frontline Australia
with a large facility management company.
‘The facilities company said to us that they wanted to put a veteran-owned business into their supply chain,’ Peter explains. ‘We connected them with Frontline Australia, who secured a multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract for integrated facility management services.’
If you’re a veteran looking to take your business to the next level, or just curious about whether a career in business could be for you, VBC is helping to organise a veteran business exhibition in Brisbane on 9 September 2025. The event is a networking and professional development opportunity, and attendees will have the chance to meet and hear from a panel of industry experts.

https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/veterans-can-earn-more-pensions-affected,Veterans can earn more before pensions affected,"From 1 July 2025, veterans can earn more, and the value of their assets can be higher, before their pension payments are affected.
The rise in income and asset amounts is in line with the annual indexation process and the income free areas and asset value limits that are used to calculate rates of income support pensions.
Different limits may apply for veterans who are assessed under transitional rules. Disability compensation payments and war widow(er)'s pensions are not subject to the income and assets tests.
Related to these thresholds increasing, some recipients of the service pension, income support supplement, veteran payment and social security age pension may see an increase to their payments.
Permanent impairment payments, eligible young person payments and the limits for household services and attendant care under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 (DRCA) have increased.
Pensioners don’t need to do anything to receive the increase.
The table below outlines the new limits and thresholds for income support payments and new MRCA and DRCA rates. For more information, including a summary of the new income and asset thresholds, pension rates and allowances please visit the

https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/80th-anniversary-battle-balikpapan,80th anniversary of the Battle of Balikpapan,"On this day in 1945, thousands of Australian troops landed on the beaches around the town of Balikpapan in south-east Borneo. Known as Oboe 2, this was the last and largest of the 3 operations that sought to liberate Japanese-held Borneo. Balikpapan’s oil refineries and airfields were seen as important for future campaigns. The landing and battle at Balikpapan, along with those at Tarakan and Brunei Bay, proved successful, though strategically questionable.
Balikpapan was the largest amphibious operation Australians undertook during the Second World War, and it was the last major battle they fought. Six weeks after it began, while troops were carrying out mopping-up operations around Balikpapan and elsewhere in Borneo, the Pacific War ended.
Designated collectively as Operation Oboe, the 3 amphibious assaults took place between 1 May and 21 July. It was conducted against Imperial Japanese forces who had been occupying Borneo since early 1942. The Australian ground troops were supported by Australian, US and other Allied air and naval forces, with the Americans providing the bulk of the shipping and logistical support.  The initial plan was to secure vital airfields and port facilities to support future operations. However, the preparatory bombardments resulted in heavy damage to Borneo’s infrastructure, including its oil production facilities. As a result, the strategic benefits that the Allies gained from the campaign were negligible.
This was certainly true of Balikpapan, which had been one of the world’s richest oil centres and a major supplier of oil to the Japanese war machine. However, because of Japanese sabotage and Allied shelling, its facilities were rendered unusable until well after the war was over.
Most of the troops deployed to Balikpapan were from the 7th Australian Division – veterans of the Middle East and New Guinea. They had been resting and training in Australia since late 1944, absorbing many reinforcements.
Australian and other Allied ships and aircraft subjected the landing area to a heavy and sustained bombardment, but the Australians did not land unopposed. Japanese forces had fortified the town and beaches and defended them stubbornly. And as the Australians pushed up the coast and further inland they encountered increasingly stiff resistance. Commanders called in aerial and naval support to minimise casualties. Tanks and artillery were landed early and brought forward to support the infantry against strongpoints. If supporting fire could not be brought to bear, sappers sealed the bunker entrances. They braved enemy fire, rushing forward and hurling explosives inside, while other bunkers were cleared with flame-throwers.
Russell Fuller was a 20-year-old soldier when he landed at Balikpapan.
‘It didn’t play on your mind, but you never knew what it was going to be like,’
he told the Australian War Memorial in 2023
. ‘You expected anything to happen at any time ... and you were always very wary. If you saw any bushes move, you stopped and went to ground, because somebody might be there looking at you, getting ready to fire... You were on the alert all the time and your eyes were never off the bushes.’
It took 3 weeks to win the Battle of Balikpapan, after which the Japanese withdrew to the rugged hills of the island. Skirmishes continued for three more weeks until the war ended.
Sadly, more than 250 Australians were killed in this battle. Japanese casualties were significantly higher.
Lest we forget.

Meal Reimbursements
If you submit a claim for trips undertaken from 1 July 2025, DVA will automatically provide a payment for meals for round trips above 100 km without the need to provide a receipt. The rate payable depends on the distance travelled, and if overnight accommodation was needed.

Accommodation Reimbursements
If you need to stay overnight, costs will be reimbursed as follows:
For commercial accommodation, if your receipt is less than DVA’s threshold amount (based on Australian Taxation Office rates), you will automatically receive a full reimbursement.  If the receipt is above the threshold, you will need to provide details explaining why the higher amount was reasonably incurred to be fully reimbursed.
For private or subsidised accommodation, DVA will reimburse you at a standard rate.  As with meals and commercial accommodation, you can submit a claim for a higher amount with a receipt and details of the reason the cost was higher than the threshold.
Meal and accommodation rates will be available on the DVA website.
