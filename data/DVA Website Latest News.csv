https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/improvements-claiming-travel-costs-under-mrca-and-drca,Improvements to claiming travel costs under MRCA and DRCA,"DVA will introduce a range of updates to the way travel claims are processed and displayed in MyService for those eligible under the
Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004
(MRCA) or the
Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related claims) Act 1988
(DRCA).
Developed in response to veteran feedback, these enhancements will improve the claiming process.
From 1 July 2025:
Claim statuses will now be available in MyService for all new MRCA and DRCA travel claims.
In most cases you will no longer be required to provide meal receipts when travelling or staying overnight. Instead, if eligible, you will automatically receive reimbursement for meal costs based on a standard rate (available from the DVA website).
You may be eligible for more than the standard rate and will
need to provide a receipt and details about the reason you incurred the cost.
While we no longer require receipts for most meal costs, we may request supporting evidence for other expense types.
If you edit an incomplete claim that you saved in MyService prior to these updates, you may need to supply additional information.

https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/navigating-life-after-service-defence-launches-transition-support-app,Navigating life after service – Defence launches transition support app,"The Department of Defence has launched a free mobile app designed to support Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and families as they navigate their transition to civilian life.
The
ADF Transition Guide
app, developed by the Joint Transition Authority (JTA), brings together the most up to date transition resources from Defence, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the broader transition support system.
These resources will guide personnel and families through every step of the transition journey, helping them to prepare with confidence, find meaningful support, and make informed decisions about their next steps.
The app was created with the understanding that each transition journey is unique, and that support needs may change based on individual circumstances and at what point in the transition journey someone is.
Whether you’re considering transition, supporting someone through theirs, or want to stay informed about transition requirements and available support services, then the
ADF Transition Guide
is for you.

https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/employ-veteran-today,Employ a veteran today,"Ex-service people can bring a range of skills that can benefit any employer or industry such as leadership, teamwork, agility and the ability to work under pressure.
The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is an incredible training ground, but when they leave the military, some ex-service people experience challenges promoting their ADF skills when applying for civilian jobs.
Yesterday, Australia’s Repatriation Commissioner, Kahlil Fegan DSC AM, appeared on
ABC News Breakfast
to discuss the valuable skills ex-service people bring to the workforce and how employers can support them and benefit from their unique skillsets.
‘Each of our veterans that are serving have particular skillsets that they become absolute experts in… there's also these values that are inculcated in our defence men and women,’ Commissioner Fegan said.
‘Respect, having integrity, having courage, seeking excellence in everything you do and loyalty… those values actually mean something.
‘When they leave the military, they don't hand those back into the Q Store on the way out, they come with them and they're the particular attributes or values that they can then apply to a new environment if they get the chance.’

The Australian Government’s Veteran Employment Program (VEP) delivers initiatives that support Australian organisations to improve employment outcomes for veterans. A key initiative is the Veteran Employment Commitment (VEC) which recognises organisations for their current workplace policies and practices that support veteran employment.
Ex-service people can use the search function on the Veteran Employment Program
website
to find organisations that demonstrate their commitment to employing veterans and creating environments where they can perform at their best.
Information on how to join the VEC, as well as employment resources for employers, ex-service people and family members can be found on the

https://www.dva.gov.au/news/latest-stories/commemorating-75th-anniversary-australian-service-korean-war,Commemorating the 75th anniversary of Australian service in the Korean War,"This year marks the 75th anniversary of Australian service in the Korean War.
On 25 June 2025, we will hold a National Commemorative Service at the Australian National Korean War Memorial in Canberra to
mark the 75th anniversary of Australian service in the Korean War and post-armistice period.
All veterans, veteran families and members of the public are invited to attend. You can
register your attendance (at no cost) via the
online registration system
.
A pre-service program will start at 10:00am. Attendees are asked to arrive early and be seated by 9:45am.
DVA has ensured there is a lot of seating capacity available at the service. Limited accessible seating will be available for those with health or accessibility requirements. If you require accessible seating, please ensure you say so when registering, and describe your accessibility requirements.
The service will also be broadcast nationally by the ABC and streamed online on iView.
This anniversary is an opportunity to honour and remember the service of all Australians who served in the Korean War, their sacrifice, and the families who supported them.
In June 1950, a mere 5 years after the Second World War ended, Australians again found themselves at war – our nation became one of the first to be involved in the Korean War.
The Korean War has been largely overshadowed by the global devastation of the Second World War and the Vietnam War – the latter being one of the longest conflicts of the 20th Century. Nevertheless, the role of Australian service personnel during the Korean War was significant and deserves national recognition.
More than 18,000 Australians served throughout the Korean War and the post-armistice ceasefire monitoring. During the war, 340 Australians lost their lives, more than 1,200 were wounded, and 30 were taken prisoner. Of those who lost their lives, 42 have no known grave.
Another 16 Australians died serving in South Korea with the ceasefire monitoring force in 1953–57, and 11 died serving in Japan with base units of British Commonwealth Forces Korea.
