Internees of Changi displayed ingenuity and resourcefulness during their imprisonment, establishing facilities including a prison library, a university, soap factory, rubber factory, pottery manufacture and broom manufacture. Also established within the prison camp was an artificial limb factory, the result of Arthur Henry Mason Purdon’s hard work and motivation.

From 1965 to 1972, 161 Independent Reconnaissance Flight (161 IRF), call sign Possums, proved to be a highly versatile unit working out of bases in Vietnam. Its work included routine daily reconnaissance flights, transferring casualties to a hospital, civilian support, and electronic surveillance, undertaking repairs, and working with other units. After arriving in Vietnam in 1965, the Possums were stationed at the Bien Hoa base, sharing space with American units for some months. When their parent unit became 1 Australian Task Force (1ATF), comprising two battalions and support units, the Possums moved to their base in the Vung Tau Special Zone. During 1965 and 1966, a major new airfield, Luscombe Field, was built at Nui Dat; this became the Possums’ base for the rest of their time in Vietnam.

The formation of the AWAS relieved men from certain military duties to serve in fighting units. Duties allocated to women took into consideration their pre-existing skills and career experience. They took up roles as draftsmen, textile repairs, cashiers, cooks and telegraph operators. Training camps for the AWAS were positioned across Australia, with several in South Australia.

Today, I take stock and reflect on the vision we created in those early days, in particular thanking our communities for their collaboration with the gallery development. The legacy of these galleries belongs to them. Museums are essential connectors and stewards of cultural identity. We began envisioning the new galleries in early 2020; looking at other world class museums, investigating the collection, exploring new opportunities and audience needs, and thinking about what new things we could do. What came out of this was the realisation that we didn’t have all of the answers (and that was OK!). To get it right, we needed to look outward, reach into our communities, seek feedback and test our assumptions.

https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/blog/the-diary-of-lieutenant-william-grubb,From Gallipoli to the Western Front: the Diary of Lieutenant William Grubb,"Private William Edward Kemp Grubb of Launceston, Tasmania was 25 years old when he and the newly-formed 26th Battalion embarked for Gallipoli on 29 June 1915. From the moment he embarked, he kept a deeply thoughtful record of his life as a soldier in the First World War, with his diaries spanning his service from 1915 to 1918. William’s diaries bring us into the emotional world of an idealistic young soldier as he grapples with the gruelling and often vicious realities of war. The 26th Battalion was met with gunfire as it landed at Anzac Cove on 12 September 1915. William recalled, “the bullets dropped around us, but not a man was hit.” Told on the troopship that he would be made lance corporal, William’s bravery and perseverance was immediately put to the test. On one of his first mornings on the front he recorded, “the scent of new slain dead was in the air and I walked on something squashy. I kept my eyes ahead and tried to think of things less gruesome.” Like many others, William used humour to keep up morale. “It was very funny despite the danger,” he wrote, describing his attempts to cook a meal while under fire; “we would cut an onion and then duck into the dug out for our lives, then out again give it a stir and in again as a shell would come whistling by … and we were laughing all through because it was comical.” Private William Edward Kemp Grubb of Launceston, Tasmania was 25 years old when he and the newly-formed 26th Battalion embarked for Gallipoli on 29 June 1915.

Appointed to the 2/4th Casualty Clearing Station, she soon embarked on the converted cruise liner Queen Mary, bound for Singapore. There she began her duties and for a short period transferred to the 2/9th Field Ambulance. On 5 August 1941, Irene was promoted to matron and posted to the 2/13th Australian General Hospital , then stationed in an incomplete hospital in Johore Bahru, Malaya. Matron Drummond was one of the 21 Australian Army nurses to be horrifically executed by the Japanese on Radji Beach during the Banka Island Massacre on 16 February 1942. The sole survivor of the massacre, Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Bullwinkel, who was a close friend to Irene, reported that she was one of the first to be shot and killed that day. As the nurses walked into the sea, where they would be executed by machine-gun, Matron Drummond uttered her final words: ""Chin up, girls. I'm proud of you and I love you all."" Vivian and Irene first met in 1935 at the Broken Hill and District Hospital while Vivian was training under Irene’s mentorship.

Numerous advertising campaigns have been launched during wartime to encourage civilians to save for the war effort. War waste was also a concern amongst the Australian Defence Force. Leadership issued routine orders urging troops to avoid waste in all forms. Some did so with authority, others with humour and flair. Collectively, their messages reveal a lesser-known issue during times of conflict: the war against waste. Efforts to reduce waste during war are well-documented.

It was stationed at Woodside Camp in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia from July until December that year, alongside two other South Australian Battalions of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The recently digitised 2/43rd Australian Infantry Battalion diaries provide insights into daily life at Woodside Camp, which contained a YMCA hut, hot baths and laundries, a camp hairdresser, field cookery units, a hospital, an army ordnance workshop, a picture theatre and a 30-yard range. Mentions of the camp picture theatre are found throughout the diaries, usually consisting of mundane reporting, such as changes in the picture theatre program. Not everyone was well behaved in the theatre. In September, complaints were made that “personnel are using obscene language in the picture theatre” and direction was issued for this to cease.
