https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/honouring-our-korean-war-veterans-75-years,Honouring our Korean War Veterans 75 years on,"As we commemorate 75 years since Australia's involvement in the Korean War, we reflect on the service and sacrifice of our Korean veterans.
In the early hours of 25 June 1950, the North Korean People’s Army (KPA) crossed the border at the 38th parallel and advanced with incredible speed to capture the Korean peninsula capital, Seoul, within three days.
The United Nations (UN) Security Council called on its members to provide assistance to the South, and 22 member nations answered the call.
Australia was the second nation, after the United States, to commit personnel from all three armed services to the war. Australian personnel from Navy, Army and Air Force were posted to both Korea and the support base in Japan.
On 1 July, HMAS Shoalhaven became the first Australian unit to see active service in the war when it escorted US troop ships to Pusan. The next day, No. 77 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew their first combat mission over Korea.
In September, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) joined the war effort, engaging in successive battles, including the fierce Battle of Kapyong where they fought off a large Chinese force trying to break through to advance on Seoul.
In the years following, thousands of additional Australian personnel from all three services took part in the war effort.
While direct conflict ended with the signing of an armistice on 27 July 1953, Australian forces remained in South Korea until 1957 when the United Nations Command was satisfied the ceasefire would hold.
Today, Australia remains a member of United Nations Command and continues to provide peacekeepers.
75 years on, we remember the more than 18,000 Australian personnel who served in Korea and those who paid the ultimate price.
We remember the wounded, those taken prisoner and the more than 40 who are missing in action, presumed dead.
We thank all those who have participated in peacekeeping efforts in the years since.
The Korean War is sometimes called the forgotten war.
To all of Australia’s Korean War veterans and their families; we commit as a nation to remember.
We say thank you for the sacrifices you made in our name.
We thank you for the way you turned out to help the people of a nation so thoroughly and illegally invaded by a belligerent neighbour.
We honour your mates who never came home and the heartache of their families who continue to mourn 75 years on.
We thank you for your service.
Lest we forget.

Now in their eighth year, the Awards continue to highlight the significant contribution Australian veterans and families make to the civilian workforce, recognising those who are opening doors, creating opportunity and helping veterans and partners in their civilian careers.
For 2025, new categories have been introduced to reflect the expanding veteran employment landscape and the innovation driving it. These include:
Champion of Veteran Employment
– Recognising individuals, organisations or collaborations that have demonstrated outstanding leadership and advocacy in veteran employment.
Best Veteran Employment Commitment Initiative
– Celebrating initiatives delivered by organisations that have joined the Veteran Employment Commitment and are delivering excellence in employment opportunities and outcomes for veterans and partners.
Best Regional Veteran Employment Initiative
– Recognising individuals, organisations or collaborations making a difference for veteran and partner employees across regional and remote Australian communities.
These new categories reflect the momentum we’re seeing across the country, as more and more organisations embrace veteran employment, these awards acknowledge emerging leaders and seek to inspire others to take action.
They complement the existing categories of Veteran Employee of the Year, Partner Employee of the Year, Veteran and/or Partner Entrepreneur of the Year, Small Employer of the Year, Medium Employer of the Year and Large Employer of the Year.
The Awards are just one way the Albanese Government’s Veteran Employment Program (VEP) continues to promote veteran employment.

Ex-service and community organisations will have the opportunity to apply for funding to support the delivery of locally and nationally significant projects that commemorate Australia’s proud military history, and ensure veterans’ legacy of heroism and service is never forgotten.
Previous grant recipients include a wide-variety of commemorative projects, including feature-length documentaries, physical memorials, and books focusing on the lesser-known stories of local veterans.
As time marches on, it’s more important than ever that we safeguard the legacy of our veterans and families, who answered the call to serve when our nation needed them.
Grants will be available across two categories – Community Grants (up to $10,000) and Major Grants (between $10,001 and $150,000).
With this year marking several significant anniversaries in Australia’s military history, including the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day and the 110th anniversary of Australia’s Gallipoli Campaign, there’s no better time to apply for funding.
Applications open Monday, 31 March 2025. To find out more or apply, visit the

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/more-150000-veterans-and-families-receive-financial-boost,"More than 150,000 veterans and families to receive a financial boost","More than 150,000 Australians receiving support through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs will soon have more money in their pockets with the latest round of indexation increasing payment rates this week.
Veteran Pensions, including the Service Pension, Disability Compensation Payment (including above General Rate), War Widow(er)’s Pension and Income Support Supplement will all increase on 20 March.
This additional cash boost would be at risk under Peter Dutton, with regular indexation part of the Coalition’s $350 billion of cuts.
Since the Albanese Labor Government came to office in 2022, we’ve been passing on indexation.
As a result, from 20 March 2025, a veteran receiving the Disability Compensation Payment (Special Rate), known as the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) Payment, has seen their payment increase by more than $7,630 per year compared to 2022.
Single people on the veteran payment will receive an increased fortnightly payment of $1,247.30 – this will see single veteran payment recipients more than $4,300 per year better off since Labor came to office.
These increases reflect the Albanese Labor Government’s determination to help Australians with cost-of-living pressures – unlike Peter Dutton who will slash these payments.
The complete list of veteran payments increasing on 20 March 2025, including income and asset limits, can be found here -

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/honouring-their-service-remembering-their-sacrifice,"Honouring their service, remembering their sacrifice","Thirty-six organisations across Australia will share in more than $575,000 of funding under Batch 2 of the 2024-25 Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants Program.
The funding will support 30 community-based projects and six major initiatives, all aimed at commemorating the service and sacrifice of Australia’s veterans and families and promoting and preserving Australia’s wartime heritage.
These grants are not just about preserving history – they’re about strengthening the bind between local communities and the legacy of our veteran community.
The 30 community grants will help fund initiatives such as installing flagpoles to proudly fly our nation’s flags, establishing gardens for moments of quiet reflection, and creating commemorative murals that encourage people to learn the stories of their local communities.
The six major grants will support larger-scale efforts, such as significant memorial refurbishments, museum exhibits, and archival projects that showcase the rich history of Australia’s wartime heritage.
The diverse submissions reflected the many stories of Australia’s service personnel, and the communities committed to preserving their legacy.
The 36 projects share a common goal: to ensure veterans’ and families’ stories are shared and continue to resonate with Australians of all ages.
Since its inception, the grant program has funded projects across the nation, enabling communities to honour their veterans in innovative and lasting ways.
Grant funding of $3.5 million is being offered in 2024-25 financial year across two categories – Community Grants (up to $10,000) and Major Grants (between $10,001 and $150,000).
A full list of Batch 2 recipients is listed in the below.
Batch 3 applications closed on 5 February 2025, with the outcome expected to be announced later this year.

This funding will help ESOs to advocate for veterans and their families as well as assist with their entitlements and compensation claims.
The Program is part of our commitment to ensuring veterans have easy access to qualified advocates who can work with them to navigate the claims process, and receive the support they need faster.
Funding delivered through the BEST grants program can be used by ESOs for staff salaries as well as administrative costs associated with the delivery of advocacy services, such as purchasing office equipment and domestic travel.
This program follows the passage of the VETS Act to simplify and harmonise Australia’s veteran compensation system, making it faster and easier to understand for veterans, families and advocates.
Applications for the 2025-26 BEST Grants round are open now, and will close at 9.00 pm AEDT on 28 April 2025. For more information about the program, including information on how to apply, visit the

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/building-leadership-skills-defence-and-veteran-spouses,Building leadership skills for defence and veteran spouses,"The Australian Government is continuing to support our valued defence and veteran families, with applications now open for a leadership development program designed for spouses.
The Women in Leadership Development program will be delivered by the Families of Veterans Guild and support its new “Rise Together Initiative”, which aims to build the career confidence of defence and veteran partners. The program will empower defence and veteran spouses to kickstart their leadership journey with tailored support, including workshops and coaching.
The program was launched this morning in Canberra by the Minister for Women, Senator the Hon Katy Gallagher and Renee Wilson, the CEO of the Families of Veterans Guild, alongside defence and veteran families.
The Families of Veterans Guild is a not-for-profit organisation that provides the defence and veteran family community with a voice, facilitates access to services and entitlements, and supports social and emotional wellbeing.
The organisation has received $92,000 to deliver the Women in Leadership Development program from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Veteran Wellbeing Grants Program.
Defence and veteran spouses can apply for the program through the Families of Veterans Guild website.
Quotes attributable to Minister Gallagher:
“Defence and veteran spouses are resilient, adaptable and resourceful – all vital leadership skills,
“However, being part of a defence family often means spouses’ careers take a back seat. This program is an important opportunity for women to build the skills and confidence to take the next steps in their careers.”
Quotes attributable to Minister Keogh:
“The sacrifices families make to support ADF members play a crucial role in protecting our nation’s security, but too often go unrecognised.
“Our Government is proud to support initiatives like this to support Defence partner employment as well as the Veteran Employment Program, in recognition of the sacrifice of these spouses from supporting their partners’ service to our nation.”

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/works-commence-greenslopes-paving-way-new-legacy-house,"Works commence at Greenslopes, paving the way for new Legacy House","A brand new Legacy House in Brisbane’s south is one step closer, with construction now underway at the former Australian Red Cross Centre site in Greenslopes.
Legacy House, right next door to Greenslopes Private Hospital, will be home to Legacy Queensland and will feature a Hub for both veterans and families, as they continue their mission of supporting the whole family unit.
The Albanese Government’s $1.5 million investment in Legacy House demonstrates how seriously we take supporting the whole family unit in order to better connect veterans to the assistance they need, when they need it.
It’s fantastic to see this project kick off following significant remediation of the site over the last few years.
Legacy House will complement our Veterans’ and Families’ Hub network, with a more holistic approach to veteran and family care, connecting medical and mental health services with advocacy and community supports in a coordinated way.
The Greenslopes site is of great military significance, previously home to the Australian Red Cross Centre as they provided critical support to countless veterans’ and their families after the Second World War.
This important history will be celebrated by preserving some architectural features into the design of Legacy House.
I’m so glad we’ve been able to ensure the significance of this historic site continues, working with the Queensland State Government, Brisbane City council and many generous businesses and individuals from across Queensland.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/recognition-and-respect-their-final-resting-place,Recognition and respect at their final resting place,"For more than a century Australians have worked tirelessly to commemorate the stories of those who have served our nation, and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
Around 270,000 Australians returned home after serving in the First World War. Many were later laid to rest without a grave marker that declared their service.
The Albanese Government can today announce almost $107,000 in funding has been allocated to nine organisations to mark the graves of 182 First World War veterans under the 2024-25 round of the Marking (First World War) Private Graves Grants Program.
The program was developed to ensure First World War veterans who lie in ‘unmarked’ graves receive the respect and recognition that they deserve.
Successful applicants will receive a one-off funding contribution of up to $620 per grave to install a commemoration, such as a new plaque or grave marker, to recognise First World War service personnel who returned home and passed away of causes unrelated to their war service.
These commemorations honour the service and sacrifice of First World War veterans in their final resting place.
It is an honour to support the work of groups and individuals across Australia who are committed to ensuring the bravery and sacrifice of our nation’s First World War veterans is remembered—and that their legacy endures.
Through this round of the Marking (First World War) Private Graves Grants Program, an additional 143 veterans were deemed eligible for official War Grave status and commemoration by the Repatriation Commission. Their service will be recognised with a Commonwealth War Grave commemoration installed at the site of interment, paid for and maintained in perpetuity by the Australian Government.

The Invictus Games is an international, adaptive multi-sports competition for current and former serving military personnel who have been wounded, injured or become ill during their military service.
Over the past week, the 33 Team Australia members competed in both individual and team sports, including alpine skiing, snowboarding, indoor rowing, biathlon, nordic skiing, sitting volleyball, skeleton, swimming, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair curling and wheelchair rugby.
Our competitors pushed themselves to new limits, celebrating personal bests and making clear that they’re not defined by their injuries.
The Australian team is supported by the Australian Defence Force and Invictus Australia.
The next Invictus Games will be held in Birmingham, United Kingdom in 2027.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/nations-appreciation,A Nation's Appreciation,"Today, on National Servicemen’s Day, Australia honours the thousands of men who served as National Servicemen, or “Nashos”.
Whether stationed at home or deployed overseas to locations including Borneo, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and Korea, Nashos played a vital role in protecting the nation.
They put their lives on hold, and on the line, to bolster Australia’s defence.
Between 1951 and 1972, more than 280,000 Australians participated in two National Service Schemes. In the 1950s Scheme, some 33,000 men were called up for annual training at 18 years old. In the 1964-1972 Scheme, more than 804,000 men registered and more than 63,000 were called up to serve through a birthday ballot.
More than 15,000 Nashos served in the Vietnam War, where some 200 lost their lives and more than 1,200 were wounded.
All national servicemen, even if they weren’t deployed, are entitled to a White Card from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that includes mental health support.
The passage of the Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Harmonisation and Simplification) Bill 2024 through Parliament on 13 February means that all claims lodged by National Servicemen on or after 1 July 2026 would be investigated and determined under the
Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004
. This could result in up to 45,000 National Serviceman becoming eligible for benefits such as Gold Cards, Special Rate Disability Pension, and access the Veterans’ Review Board, which has not been available to them under previous legislation.
Today we honour all Nashos and pay tribute to those who lost their lives. We owe them all a debt of gratitude for their service to the nation.

The Albanese Government has appointed Mr Michael Manthorpe PSM as the Interim Head of the Defence and Veterans’ Service Commission. Mr Manthorpe will head the interim organisation and work across government to deliver the establishment of a legislated oversight body by September 2025.
This appointment is a significant milestone in implementing recommendation 122 of the Royal Commission’s Final Report.

The Albanese Government is committed to the delivery of the entity which will provide independent oversight and evidence-based advice to improve suicide prevention, and drive better outcomes for serving and ex-serving ADF personnel.
As part of the Albanese Government’s response to the Royal Commission, we have committed $9.5 million of funding, as part of MYEFO, to support its implementation, including:
$5 million over two years to fund the appointment of the Interim Head of the Defence and Veterans’ Service Commission, and to establish a cross agency taskforce to provide advice to Government; and
$4.5 million in 2024-25 to fund consultations for both a new agency within DVA focused on veteran wellbeing and a new peak body for ex-service organisations.

Defence and Veteran Family Wellbeing Strategy 2025-2030
(The Family Strategy).
This delivers on Labor’s election commitment to identify ways to better support the families of our Defence personnel and veterans.
The related Action plan will further assist in responding to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide’s Final Report.
The Strategy and its associated Action Plan will focus on three priorities:
Informed engagement
— Families can find the information they need when they need it. This will help them to access available supports and make informed decisions.
Supported and secure
— Veterans and their families are supported to manage the impacts of their service and key life events through policies that are flexible and fit-for-purpose.
Recognised and Understood
— Continuous efforts are made to better understand family needs, including through research, engagement and evaluation.
Delivering the Strategy will help families to access appropriate housing solutions, offer greater certainty around locations for Defence Force personnel and their families, and provide better support during and after transition from ADF service.
The Strategy and Action Plan were developed in consultation with Defence and veteran families, whose lived experience provide the foundations for this document and the actions we will now take.
The Strategy and Action plan can be found on the
DVA website

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/joint-communique-veterans-ministerial-council-1,Joint Communique - Veterans' Ministerial Council,"Federal, State and Territory Ministers responsible for veterans’ matters met today to discuss how they can best work together to implement the Government’s response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.
The rate of veteran suicide is a national tragedy, and there is no time to waste in taking action on the recommendations of the Royal Commission.
The Council was briefed on the Response, in which the Australian Government agreed or agreed in principle to 104 of the Royal Commission’s 122 recommendations.
An additional 17 recommendations were noted for further work, while only one recommendation was not agreed to in part. Of the 17 recommendations noted for further work, five specifically refer to work to be considered in collaboration with the states and territories.
The Council agreed the Response will involve the most comprehensive reform of the culture, systems and processes supporting Defence personnel, veterans and veteran families ever undertaken.
In response to Recommendation 122 of the Final Report, for a new independent oversight body, the Albanese Government will prioritise the establishment of the Defence and Veterans Services Commission by September 2025, to oversee reform across the whole Defence ecosystem.
In the immediate term, a new taskforce will be established in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C), to provide advice to Government on implementing the reforms over the short and long term, while prioritising the health and safety of Defence personnel and veterans.
The federal Department of Veterans’ Affairs will consult with the veteran community on a new agency focused on veteran wellbeing and continue consultation on a peak body for ex-service organisations.
For recommendations involving the states and territories, further work will be undertaken through the Commonwealth, State and Territory Committee and the new PM&C taskforce.
The Ministers agreed to work collaboratively on implementing the recommendations through the Commonwealth, State and Territory Committee, and to improve services and support for the veteran community across the nation.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/governments-response-final-report-royal-commission-defence-and-veteran-suicide,Government’s response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide,"The Albanese Government has today released its response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, setting out a plan for real, meaningful and enduring reform for Defence personnel, veterans and families.
The Royal Commission was the most significant and comprehensive inquiry conducted into suicide and suicidality in Defence and veteran communities. It heard harrowing evidence about the cultural problems within the Australian Defence Force (ADF) over time and identified deficiencies with the approach, services and support of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA).
The Albanese Government has accepted the overwhelming majority of the Royal Commission’s 122 recommendations: agreeing or agreeing-in-principle to 104 recommendations, noting 17 recommendations for further consideration and one recommendation is not supported in part.
Implementing this response will result in the most comprehensive reform ever undertaken to the culture, systems and processes across Defence, the ADF and DVA to prevent suicide and improve the mental health and wellbeing of serving personnel and veterans.
Consistent with key recommendations of the Royal Commission, the Government will:
Establish a new statutory entity to oversee enduring and systemic reform. This entity will provide independent oversight and evidence-based advice to improve suicide prevention, and drive better outcomes for serving and ex-serving ADF personnel.
An interim head will be appointed as soon as possible to work across government towards the establishment of a legislated oversight body by September 2025.
Establish a Taskforce in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which will draw in expertise from across Government as well as external experts to consider matters of detailed implementation.
Direct DVA to co-design, with the veteran community, a new agency focused on wellbeing to be established within DVA. This body will be focused on consultation and co-design with Defence and veteran communities, and their families, to ensure the agency meets their needs.
Fund DVA to continue consultation on the development of a national ex-service organisation peak body.
These reforms will be rolled out together with the implementation of the National Defence Strategy, to ensure that Defence’s most important capability – its people – receive the support and services they deserve as they work to keep Australians safe.
Work already underway
In August 2022, the Royal Commission’s Interim Report was delivered to Government, and we took swift action on all of its recommendations.
The reforms set out today build on the work already completed in response to the Interim Report, as well as the extensive work across Defence and DVA that commenced from the moment the Albanese Government took office, including:
Fully funding the Government’s response to the Royal Commission’s Interim Report, including $233.9 million to engage 500 new frontline staff at DVA to eliminate the compensation claims backlog, delivering on a key election commitment made by the Government.
Undertaking extensive consultation to develop legislation to simplify and harmonise the veteran compensation system. Legislation was introduced to the Parliament 3 July 2024.
Investing $254.1 million over four years to modernise and sustain DVA’s ageing IT systems to ensure more timely payments and better access to services for veterans and families.
In June 2023, the Government appointed the first three star Chief of Personnel who reports directly to the Chief of the Defence Force to drive systemic reform across the ADF.
Expanding and improving allowances, conditions of services and entitlements for serving ADF personnel and their families.
Investing more than $600 million to implement the 2024 Defence Workforce Plan and grow the ADF to deliver an integrated, focused force.
The implementation of the Government’s response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission will see the most comprehensive reform to the systems, processes and culture supporting Defence personnel and veterans ever undertaken in Australia.
Whilst this is a large and complex task, these reforms will ensure those who pursue a career in the ADF are supported from the time they join, throughout transition and in life after service.
The establishment of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide would not have occurred without those families who have lost loved ones, and advocates such as Senator Lambie. The Government thanks all those who bravely came forward to share their stories and give evidence to the Royal Commission. Their courage has made an enormous difference.
The Government’s full response to the Royal Commission is available on the
Defence
and
DVA
websites.
Quotes attributable to Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese:
“We have lost too many lives, and every single one is heartbreaking. Today I want to acknowledge every family and friend grieving the loss of a loved one.
“We called for this Royal Commission in Opposition and we supported it in Government.
“Today’s response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission is an historic opportunity to deliver lasting reform and support our Defence personnel, veterans and their families.”
Quotes attributable to Deputy Prime Minister, Richard Marles:
“The death by suicide of any Australian, including veterans and serving Defence personnel, is a national tragedy. Implementing the Royal Commission’s recommendations is not a simple task, but it is essential.
“The Albanese Government’s Response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission is our plan for systemic and enduring reform to make sure we are supporting our Defence and veteran communities.”
Quotes attributable to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Defence Personnel, Matt Keogh:
“We thank all those who came forward and bravely told their story to the Royal Commission. Your courage and the Royal Commission’s work directs the necessary change needed to save lives.
“The Government’s response to the Royal Commission will deliver changes in Defence and DVA that will improve the lives of serving personnel, veterans and families today and into the future.”

The event is an important opportunity to acknowledge the incredibly valuable contribution veterans make in civilian life and the employers who support them.
By shining a light on their successes, the Awards encourage civilian organisations to embrace the wealth of experience and capability that veterans bring to their teams.
The valuable skills and experience veterans gain in the Australia Defence Force are transferrable to any number of civilian roles and organisations – they might just not be spelt out in the way you would expect on a CV.
The 2024 Prime Minister’s National Veteran Employment Awards are part of the Australian Government’s $24 million Veteran Employment Program.
The Awards come at a time when the Government is working to respond to the final report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, a culmination of the most significant and comprehensive inquiry conducted into suicide and suicidality in the Defence and veteran community.
Quotes attributable to the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese:
“It’s an honour to recognise the incredible efforts of these individuals and organisations in the veteran employment space.”
“These Awards serve as a powerful reminder of the remarkable contributions veterans make to the community each and every day. Congratulations to all the winners.”
Quotes attributable to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Defence Personnel, Matt Keogh:
“These awards demonstrate just how much the veteran community has to offer after their Australian Defence Force service.
The Royal Commission made it clear that there is more to do to improve transition for veterans, we’re taking that seriously and the Veteran Employment Program plays a significant part in that.”

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/joint-statement-we-remember-them,Joint Statement - We remember them,"When people think of those who pull on a uniform bearing Australia’s flag, they often think of
those heading into war or conflict.
But there are also those who have done, and continue to do so, to maintain peace.
November 11 is the anniversary of the armistice which ended the First World War in 1918.
In the years since, Remembrance Day has become a day where we turn our minds to all of
those who have served our nation – in war, conflict and peacekeeping operations – and the
103,000 Australians who have fallen.
In September, we commemorated the 25th anniversary of Australian service in Timor-Leste.
Around 5,500 Australian service personnel were initially deployed there as part of the
International Force East Timor, the largest deployment of Australian troops since the Vietnam
War. We pay tribute to the six Australians who tragically lost their lives as a result of their
service in Timor-Leste.
Today, Australian Defence Force personnel continue to support peacekeeping efforts across the
globe – part of the more than 2,500 members currently deployed on operations.
This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the conclusion of Operation SLIPPER, honouring
all who served in Afghanistan as part of Australia's longest war.
An estimated 39,000 Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed during more than a
decade of combat operations in Afghanistan, including an estimated 26,000 deployed for
Operation SLIPPER. We remember the 41 members of our Defence Force who were killed in
Afghanistan and we acknowledge those who returned with injury, both seen and unseen.
On this day 106 years ago, the guns fell silent on the Western Front. After years of bloodshed,
red poppies began to bloom on the devastated battlefields across Europe.
Those poppies became a symbol of sacrifice and hope. We still cherish them as our flower of
remembrance.
As we wear those poppies today, we pause to pay tribute to all of the Australians who have
served in our Defence Force for their commitment and sacrifice to our nation.
We will remember them. Lest we forget.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/2024-prime-ministers-national-veteran-employment-awards-finalists-announced,2024 Prime Minister’s National Veteran Employment Awards Finalists Announced,"Today I’m pleased to announce Australia’s top employers and employees in the veteran community, the 2024 finalists for the Prime Minister’s National Veteran Employment Awards.
The Awards champion veteran employment, showcasing the valuable skills veterans bring to the civilian workforce and recognise the individuals and organisations supporting them.
Veterans, through their training in the ADF, gain skills like leadership, teamwork, the ability to work under pressure - skills that can be transferred to any civilian industry.
This year’s finalists demonstrate outstanding leadership and dedication to enhancing veteran employment opportunities, not only supporting veterans and their families, but setting the benchmark for success, no matter the industry.
The Awards are a cornerstone of the Veteran Employment Program, which actively supports veterans in civilian roles and helps organisations create environments where veterans and veteran partners can thrive as employees.
The Albanese Government’s $24 million Veteran Employment Program encourages employers to recruit and retain veterans, build inclusive work environments, and provide targeted supports for the veteran community, including recognition of prior learning and experience gained in service through vocational training and universities.
Winners will be announced at a ceremony in November at Old Parliament House in Canberra.
The finalists for the 2024 Awards are:

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/keep-connected-veterans-health-week,Keep connected this Veterans' Health Week,"Veterans’ Health Week is our annual reminder that while service takes a toll on veterans and families, there are so many innovative ways and support opportunities to maintain and improve mental health and keep connected.
With so many people losing contact with their mates - their Defence family - when they leave service, it’s so important that people find new ways to keep in touch after transition.
This year’s theme for Veterans’ Health Week is ‘Keep Connected’, which highlights the importance of staying socially connected to family, friends and peers.
As we work through the findings of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide’s Final Report, this fact becomes all the more apparent.
Every year the Australian Government collaborates with community groups, ex-service organisations and advocates to promote a healthy lifestyle in the veteran community through Veterans’ Health Week.
This year there are more than 780 registered Veterans’ Health Week events happening across the country, with everything from cooking lessons to pickleball, Pilates and even axe throwing.
No matter your taste, there’s something for everyone available in every state and territory.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/opinion-piece-weve-let-diggers-down-too-long-we-cant-fail-them-again,Opinion Piece - We've let diggers down for too long. We can't fail them again.,"The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide has made it abundantly clear that for decades Australia’s Defence personnel, veterans and indeed their families have not been treated as they should have been.
They’ve been failed by successive Australian governments.
The harrowing stories we’ve heard from veterans and their loved ones over the last three years has made sure that fact is now undeniable.
They’re stories that cannot be swept under the rug, can’t be left to gather dust on a shelf.
They’re a call to action.
And the time for action is now.
The Albanese Government fought for the Royal Commission from Opposition, because the rate of defence and veteran suicide is a national tragedy.
This week the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed that between 1997 and 2022 there were 1,763 known deaths by suicide amongst serving and ex-serving personnel.
As a Government, we’re committed to taking action, and taking that action swiftly.
The Albanese Government will be delivering our response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide’s 122 recommendations, before the year is out.
We are working through those recommendations and their detail, meticulously stepped out in more than 3,100 pages, across seven volumes, in a timely and methodical manner.
Since Monday, 9 September, the day the report was delivered to Government, we’ve been working on how and when these recommendations can be implemented.
The Royal Commission has noted governments at all levels must work together to improve veterans’ wellbeing and reduce the risk of suicide and suicidality. So I’ve already met with my State and Territory counterparts to start this work.
In recent decades we’ve seen some 57 inquiries and more than 770 recommendations for change – and ultimately not much to show for it.
I appreciate the apprehension from across the Defence and veteran community that we won’t take up the challenge put to us by this Royal Commission.
We remain accountable and must serve you better, after all, you’ve done your job, serving for us.
Recommendation 122 of the Final Report was to “establish a new statutory entity to oversee system reform across the whole Defence ecosystem”.
This is not a new idea.
The Albanese Government agrees with the need for an independent oversight body as recommended by the Royal Commission and is working through the detail of this and the other recommendations through the usual Cabinet processes.
I hope you take this as a sign of things to come, and judge us not on what we say, but what we do.
In this regard it is worth noting that we have taken action on every recommendation made by the Royal Commission in its 2022 Interim Report, with 9 of its 13 recommendations already implemented in full.
I want to thank everyone who helped campaign for and who contributed to the Royal Commission for their bravery in sharing often harrowing stories about their own experience in service, and those who have given a voice to loved ones no longer able to share their own story.
I also thank the Commissioners for their important and sensitive work.
One death is one too many. We must do what we can, as quickly as we can, to prevent suicide across our Defence and veteran community.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/joint-communique-veterans-ministerial-council-0,Joint communiqué - Veterans’ Ministerial Council,"Federal, State and Territory Ministers responsible for veterans’ matters met in Canberra today to enhance cooperation to better support veterans and their families in light of the Final Report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.
Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide
The Ministers recognised those who bravely shared their personal stories with the Royal Commission and noted the Royal Commission’s comment “governments at all levels must work together to improve veterans’ wellbeing and reduce the risk of suicide and suicidality.”
Ministers agreed on the need to work collaboratively to improve services and supports for the veteran community and that a timely response to the Royal Commission’s Final Report is necessary. The Royal Commission was a comprehensive inquiry resulting in 122 final recommendations that are currently under consideration by all levels of Government, noting that 9 of the recommendations require action by States and Territories in conjunction with the Commonwealth. Ministers agreed to the First Secretaries Group be requested to identify appropriate members of an inter-jurisdictional working group to consider State and Territory implications of recommendations and report back to relevant Ministers.
Ministers acknowledged the action taken by the Australian Government on all recommendations of the Royal Commission’s 2022 Interim Report.
Legislation Reform
The Ministers were provided with an update on veterans’ legislation reform following the Australian Government introducing the Veterans’ Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024 (VETS Bill) into the Federal Parliament on 3 July 2024. This Bill is in response to the first recommendation of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide’s Interim Report and is informed by a comprehensive consultation process.
The Bill is currently before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 3 October 2024.
Harmonisation of veteran concessions
At the last Council meeting, Ministers acknowledged the need for clearer and more consistent veteran concession arrangements around the country. Since then, the Commonwealth State and Territory Committee (CSTC) has been undertaking a comparison of concession types and eligibility rules across Australia, which was presented to council.
The Council agreed to consider the harmonisation of transport, vehicle and household concessions and publish each jurisdiction’s current concessions on the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) website for public visibility.
Veteran identifiers
The Council noted the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide Final Report contains a number of recommendations regarding the creation and use of a Veteran Data Asset by the Commonwealth as well as the States and Territories.
The Council discussed the risks and opportunities of introducing ‘veteran identifiers’ in sectors such as health, aged care, the corrections system and education across all Australian States and Territories. While it was acknowledged the implementation of such mechanisms would be a decision for the Commonwealth, as well as each State and Territory government, the Ministers recognised the benefits identifiers could provide for members of the Defence and veteran community, as well as the clear desire of the Royal Commission for a consistent and positive approach to these matters by the Commonwealth, States and Territories.
Improving access for veterans with a Psychiatric Assistance Dog
At the last Council meeting, Ministers discussed the need for harmonisation of cross jurisdictional arrangements for veterans and their Psychiatric Assistance Dogs, as well as national standards for providers. A working group has since been formed to progress work to improve public access for veterans with a Psychiatric Assistance Dog (PAD), with Ministers continuing to express their support for a national approach. Ministers agreed that DVA proceed with an “Access Rights Information Card” and identification symbol for PAD’s provided and certified by DVA. State and Territory Ministers will work within their jurisdiction to ensure recognition of such identifiers.
Veteran Aged Care
The Council was briefed on DVA’s Aged and Community Care Taskforce, which was established in January 2024. The Taskforce aims to improve veteran and family access and support in navigating the complexities of the aged care sector. Central to its work is establishing strong connections between DVA programs across the Commonwealth, and the States and Territories. The Taskforce’s purpose is to deliver a structured approach to DVA aged care services that reflects changing client demographics, leverages partnerships, and enables DVA to respond to changes occurring across the aged care sector.
The Council also noted that the Commonwealth introduced its Aged Care Bill 2024 into Parliament on 12 September 2024.
Tasmanian Mental Health Program
The Council was updated on a program Open Arms has developed in partnership with the Tasmanian Health Service and Primary Health Network to enhance access to mental health services for veterans and families in Tasmania.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/tabling-final-report-royal-commission-defence-and-veteran-suicide,Tabling of the Final Report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide,"The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide Final Report has been delivered to the Government and tabled in Parliament today.
The Report is an important body of work which marks the culmination of the most significant and comprehensive inquiry conducted into suicide and suicidality in the Defence and veteran communities.
In August 2022, the Interim Report of the Royal Commission was delivered to government, and we took swift action on all of its recommendations.
These recommendations were centred on the transition of veterans and families including: simplifying and harmonising the claims system and eliminating the backlog we inherited on coming to government, enhancing access to support services and information access for families of those who have taken their lives, including in the transition of veterans to civilian life.
The Albanese Government continues to demonstrate our commitment to improving the welfare of Defence personnel, veterans and their families. We have been working to deliver this real change every day.
Our priority is ensuring that those who pursue a career in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have a safe and inclusive workplace and are supported from the time they join, through transition, and after service.
We welcome the Report and thank the Commissioners for a thorough and compassionate inquiry. We also thank the families and veterans who shared their stories with the Commission. We will now work through the recommendations and provide a formal government response.
All serving and ex-serving ADF personnel and their families should know that if they need support they can contact Open Arms for free, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on 1800 011 046 or visit

Quotes attributable to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, the Hon Richard Marles MP:
“I thank the members of our Defence Force, our veterans and their loved ones who bravely shared their stories with the Royal Commission.
“This has been a thorough inquiry, and we will take the time to carefully consider the recommendations of the Final Report.
“Our priority is ensuring that those who pursue a career in the ADF have a safe and inclusive workplace and are supported from the time they join, through transition, and after service.”
Quotes attributable to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Defence Personnel, the Hon Matt Keogh MP:
“The rate of veteran suicide is a national tragedy and this Royal Commission has played a vital role in learning what can be done better to improve the lives of Defence personnel, veterans and families.
“We’ve acted quickly on the recommendations from the Royal Commission’s Interim Report and I’m pleased that legislation to simplify and harmonise the veteran compensation system is now before the Parliament.
“I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, sharing their often harrowing stories in the interests of improving things for their mates, and those who will come after them.”

There’s more to war, conflict and peace operations than what is recorded in history books. For many people it was, and is, a significant chapter in their lives, and their service and sacrifices are remembered and told by these young Australians.
The entries were broad, showcasing the respectful and imaginative ways that students learnt about Australia’s military history and the experiences of veterans in their local community.
Entries included websites, songs, roving reporters, memorial gardens and walls, wreaths made from flowers grown at the school, artwork, crochet, dioramas, poetry, re-enactments, posters and even an escape room.
The winner of both the National Award and Brigadier Bill Rolfe AO award for veteran involvement was St Patrick’s College for Girls in Campbelltown, New South Wales, building an impressive website dedicated to telling the stories of local veterans who served in conflicts and peacekeeping missions since the First World War.
Entries for the 2025 Anzac Day Schools’ Awards are now open with the theme ‘
Remembering Gallipoli: 110 years

Marking First World War Private Graves Grants Program
.
When we say “lest we forget” we mean it: we will remember them, we do remember them.
All over the country, dedicated community organisations work tirelessly to identify the graves of long lost WWI veterans.
This program was developed to support these organisations in their important work, as they seek to acknowledge these veterans, many of whom lie in unmarked graves, as they so deserve.
To enable the appropriate marking of graves, this year, grant funding has been increased by $170, with up to $620 available per grave.
In 2023, this program delivered funding for 42 graves of veterans whose death was not related to their war service to be marked around the country.
Importantly, research undertaken as a result of this program meant 44 veterans were also identified to be eligible for official War Grave status and commemoration.
Applications close on 5 November 2024.

https://minister.dva.gov.au/news-and-media/minister/new-legislation-simplify-and-harmonise-veteran-compensation,New legislation to simplify and harmonise veteran compensation,"The Albanese Government is simplifying and harmonising Australia’s veterans’ rehabilitation and compensation system – with new legislation introduced today.
Under the Veterans’ Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, all new compensation claims from 1 July 2026 will be dealt with under a single piece of legislation – an improved Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) – regardless of when or where the veteran served.
This is another important step in responding to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide’s Interim Report and is the result of significant community consultation.
In August 2022, the Royal Commission told us that legislation governing compensation and rehabilitation for veterans and their families is ‘so complicated that it adversely affects the mental health of some veterans and can be a contributing factor to suicidality’.
After decades of piecemeal change built on top of a century of different veterans’ entitlements legislation, these reforms will deliver a system that is easier for veterans and families to understand what they are entitled to, and will make it simpler for veteran advocates to assist veterans, so veterans receive the benefits and supports they need and deserve.
Importantly the legislation will enable the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to process claims quicker – so the veteran community can receive the benefits and supports they need and deserve in a timely manner.
As part of these reforms, the Government is enhancing various entitlements including:
The introduction of a new Additional Disablement Amount (ADA), similar to the existing Extreme Disablement Adjustment (EDA) under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA). This would compensate veterans who are Age Pension age or older and who have a high degree of incapacity due to service-related conditions.
Introduction of ‘presumptive liability’, allowing the Repatriation Commission to specify injuries and diseases that can be determined on a presumptive basis where they are known to have a common connection with military service – without needing to engage with the Statement of Principles system.
Consolidation of household and attendant care, travel for treatment, and retention of automatic granting of VEA funeral benefits in the MRCA.
An increase to $3,000 for funeral allowance for previous automatic grant categories under the VEA, and the availability of reimbursement of funeral expenses up to $14,062 for all service-related deaths.
The availability to all veterans of the higher reimbursement amount, regardless of kilometres, when a private vehicle is used to travel for treatment.
Standardisation of allowances and other payments, including: acute support packages, Victoria Cross and decoration allowances, education schemes, prisoner of war ex gratia payments, and additional compensation for children of severely impaired veterans.
Enhancement of the Repatriation Commission’s ability to grant special assistance to veterans and their dependants.
Veterans in receipt of Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence Related Claims) Act 1988 (DRCA) incapacity payments will automatically transition to MRCA incapacity payments on the date of commencement.
Where the Repatriation Medical Authority updates a Statement of Principle between the veteran’s primary and reviewable decision, the version of the Statement which is most beneficial to the veteran’s circumstances will be applied.
Introduction of an instrument making power that will enable the Commission to determine circumstances where a veteran must receive financial advice before receiving a lump sum payment.
Under our changes, no veteran will see a reduction to their benefits.
Where a veteran is currently receiving benefits under an existing scheme, that will continue unaffected.
This year’s Federal Budget set aside an additional $222 million for veteran and family entitlements across the two years from commencement of this legislation.
