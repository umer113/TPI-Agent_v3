A word from Gwen
Image
As the Veteran Family Advocate Commissioner, my main role is to represent veteran families and work towards improving policies, programs, and services that help them deal with the challenges of Defence and veteran family life. I do this by collaborating with the community, finding areas that need improvement, and advocating for flexible and supportive systems for veteran families and this covers everything from enlistment to the end of their lives and beyond.
In my position, I make sure that DVA considers the needs of families and adopts practices that are sensitive to their unique situations. I also engage with and examine issues that affect veteran families, providing advice on policies and operations. I identify any gaps in the services available to veteran families and speak up for them, sharing their stories and highlighting their importance in the well-being of veterans and their families. I also work on connecting DVA with other services to create a comprehensive support network for veterans and their families.
As part of my role, I lead veteran family engagement on behalf of the Minister for Veterans Affairs and I do this by actively building relationships with various government agencies, the veteran community, and organisations representing the interests of veteran families. These connections help me stay updated on the latest developments and collaborate effectively.

Advocacy and Achievements
Reflecting on my time in the role, I am reminded that change takes time, and comes about through small iterative steps. But over time these changes accumulate, and it’s only when you pause and look back that you can see how far you’ve come. Since starting in my role, I have seen a lot of change take place in how veteran families are supported.
I use a simple, living document to track milestones and wins along the way to serve and provide transparency regarding the efforts of the Veteran Family Advocate Commissioner Office. It encompasses achievements and ongoing advocacy spanning several years. When observing the content within, one can gain a wide-ranging understanding of the positive developments and the continued endeavours to enhance support for veteran families:

Stress-response and metabolic systems in children living in military and first responder families: Potential for targets for individualising exercise treatment of anxiety?
This study will provide an integrated understanding of childhood anxiety by investigating the responses of these systems to an acute exercise bout before and after a five-week exercise intervention in children (5-9 years) living in military or first responder families. The study aims to develop a screening tool for investigating possible dysregulated biological mechanisms associated with anxiety and investigate the effects of an individualised five-week exercise intervention to improve these mechanisms and assist in the treatment of youth anxiety in military and first-responder families.

Health of Veterans Report
Veterans – permanent, reserve and ex-serving members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) – and their families are an important population group for health and welfare monitoring. The unique nature of ADF service promotes protective factors that can lead to improved health outcomes but also exposes members to risk factors that may lead to poor health during and after their military service.

Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) for veterans and veteran families
Launched a dedicated webpage for Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) for veterans and veteran families. The intention of the page is to support clients (or any interested party) to identify FDV, and outline supports offered by DVA in simple digestible language consistent with trauma informed practice. It is also in keeping with crisis sensitivity, providing short succinct information and a quick exit option.

Crisis Payment
The Crisis Payment is designed to assist the person to establish themselves in a new residence following extreme circumstances forcing departure from the home such as natural disasters, or, for a victim of domestic or family violence to re-establish their current residence after the perpetrator of the violence has left or been removed from the home. A Crisis Payment may also be payable following release from lawful custody.

Partners Service Pension (PSP)
Partners of veterans in receipt of the Partner Service Pension (PSP), who separate because of the veteran's abusive behaviour, may continue to receive the payment indefinitely. This was a commitment in the Fourth Action Plan - National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010–2022, which extended eligibility to support more former partners experiencing family and domestic violence.

Resolute Ready - One Stop Shop
A global mental health hub for everyone.  We are not a clinical professional or government organisation. We are a community who have first-hand experience of the mental and physical challenges that are experienced by many returned Veterans. We exist to see a stop in the generational cycle of service trauma in Military, First Responder connected families, to see relationships restored, and to do what we can to prevent suicide. We support the community in Mental Health.

Open Arms Veterans and Families Counselling
Health of Veterans and Families
Open Arms model of care
The Open Arms model of care is family inclusive, recognising the importance of engaging family members to address the potential impact of mental health issues and military service on veterans and their families.
Families have needs in their own right and are able to access Open Arms services independent of the veterans, who may or may not access the service themselves.
Open Arms services include counselling for individuals, couples and families; group programs to enhance support; lived experience peer support (including family peers); after hours telephone counselling; and mental health literacy training.
