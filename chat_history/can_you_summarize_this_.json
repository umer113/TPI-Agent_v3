This independent statutory authority is responsible for determining Statements of Principles (SOPs) for diseases or injuries that could be linked to military service based on sound medical-scientific evidence.\n\nStatements of Principles:\nThe SOPs outlined by the RMA are binding on various decision-making bodies, including the Repatriation Commission, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These SOPs set forth the specific factors required to establish a connection between a veteran's military service and a particular disease, injury, or death.\n\nWebsite Features:\nThe RMA website provides users with access to information about the authority, its membership, processes, and publications. Users can easily search for SOPs using the website's improved search function, which allows for searches by SOP number, year, condition name, or ICD code. Additionally, stakeholders can find answers to common questions on the FAQs page and submit requests for investigations or reviews online.\n\nJoin Our Mailing List:\nIndividuals interested in receiving the latest updates from the RMA can subscribe to the mailing list through the website.
