    "content": "ðŸª“ Breaking the Broken Digger Narrative: Unveiling the Truth Behind Veteran Support\nBy The Property Investigator (TPI) â€” July 2025\n\nThe tale of veteran support often spins like a broken record, but beneath the surface lies a narrative as fractured as it is overlooked. Letâ€™s dig deep into the latest issues of Vetaffairs to uncover the untold stories, challenges, and triumphs hidden within the pages.\n\n**Unmasking the Reality**\nIn the December 2024 issue of Vetaffairs, amidst the holiday cheer, Commissioner Kahlil Fegan challenges the 'Broken Digger' narrative, urging us to see beyond the facade of support to the struggles that persist. From combating scammers to advocating for mental health training, the battle for true support rages on.\n\n**Shining Light on Untold Stories**\nIn the August 2024 edition, we witness a mosaic of experiences, from the expansion of the Veteransâ€™ and Familiesâ€™ Hubs network to the fight against veteran homelessness. The narrative of support is complex, with layers of initiatives striving to mend the broken threads of care and understanding.\n\n**A Call for Unity**\nAcross the volumes of Vetaffairs, voices echo the need for collaboration, understanding, and unwavering support for those who have served. The stories within these pages paint a picture of resilience, courage, and the ongoing struggle to break free from the shackles of a narrative in dire need of repair.\n\nAs we journey through the stories of Vetaffairs, let us not forget the faces, voices, and battles fought by our veterans. The broken narrative of support may linger, but within its cracks lie stories of hope, strength, and the unyielding spirit of those who have sacrificed for our nation.\n\nStay tuned for more insights as we unravel the truths behind the broken digger narrative, one story at a time."

Here are the articles with bold headings:\n\n**Opportunity for Second World War veterans to travel to Canberra for Victory in the Pacific Day, Last Post Ceremony**\nEach year, on 15 August, we mark Victory in the Pacific (VP) Day, the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. This year, as we commemorate the 80th anniversary of this defining moment in history, we are inviting expressions of interest from veterans of the Second World War to travel to Canberra to attend the Last Post Ceremony at the Australian War Memorial.\nThis special ceremony will honor and pay tribute to the men and women who served in the Second World War, with extended elements to mark the significance of this 80th anniversary. Veterans of the Second World War who served with the Australian Defence Force, including nurses and Womenâ€™s Land Army members, are invited to express their interest in attending by registering via this online form.

Five years and a rebrand later, the Veteran Business Community (VBC) is as committed as ever to supporting veterans and their families on their journey to self-employment through entrepreneurship. â€˜Our goal is to see veteran entrepreneurship become an established transition pathway from the military,â€™ Peter says. Military service equips veterans with many skills and attributes that are directly transferrable to successful business ownership. â€˜Veterans have strong skills in leadership, organization, and operations â€“ being able to project manage, forecast, and look at risk. When we are looking at soft skills, itâ€™s the drive, determination, problem-solving, persistence, and courage,â€™ Peter says. â€˜However, there are some significant knowledge gaps, and those gaps are sales and marketing, cash flow, and accounting. â€˜VBC steps in to support those gaps, helping people to understand branding and marketing, lead capture and lead generation. How to actually sell. Then it will go back to their strengths of operational delivery.â€™ To support veteran entrepreneurs, VBC offers quarterly business boot camps, mentorship, and networking opportunities. Peter has also started up a podcast, Military Mind for Business, where heâ€™s joined by other veterans to discuss what it takes to build a successful business. VBC is working hard to promote â€˜buying veteranâ€™ by introducing veteran-owned businesses into major industry supply chains. Theyâ€™ve secured a new partnership with Gateway by ICN to spotlight veteran-owned businesses on its platform. The Gateway connects small-to-medium enterprises to major projects and will offer greater access to large-scale corporate and government contracts. When signing up with VBC, member businesses undergo a formal registration process to identify as â€˜veteran-owned.â€™ â€˜Supporting veteran-owned businesses and putting veteran-owned business in your supply chain is about the quality and character and commitment of the people behind the business,â€™ Peter emphasizes. â€˜We donâ€™t believe in preferential treatment, but we believe a veteranâ€™s service should be a point of difference.â€™ In just one of many success stories, VBC connected community member Frontline Australia with a large facility management company. â€˜The facilities company said to us that they wanted to put a veteran-owned business into their supply chain,â€™ Peter explains. â€˜We connected them with Frontline Australia, who secured a multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract for integrated facility management services.â€™ If youâ€™re a veteran looking to take your business to the next level, or just curious about whether a career in business could be for you, VBC is helping to organize a veteran business exhibition in Brisbane on 9 September 2025. The event is a networking and professional development opportunity, and attendees will have the chance to meet and hear from a panel of industry experts.

The rise in income and asset amounts is in line with the annual indexation process and the income free areas and asset value limits that are used to calculate rates of income support pensions. Different limits may apply for veterans who are assessed under transitional rules. Disability compensation payments and war widow(er)'s pensions are not subject to the income and assets tests. Related to these thresholds increasing, some recipients of the service pension, income support supplement, veteran payment, and social security age pension may see an increase to their payments. Permanent impairment payments, eligible young person payments, and the limits for household services and attendant care under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 (DRCA) have increased. Pensioners donâ€™t need to do anything to receive the increase. The table below outlines the new limits and thresholds for income support payments and new MRCA and DRCA rates. For more information, including a summary of the new income and asset thresholds, pension rates, and allowances please visit the DVA payment rates page. New maximum limits and thresholds from 1 July 2025 Amount of income an income support recipient may receive before their pension is reduced Single rate (fortnightly) Couples rate - combined (fortnightly) Service or Age Pension $ 218.00 $ 380.00 Income Support Supplement (War Widow(er)'s Pension is included in these amounts)* $ 1,792.60 $ 2,411.60 Maximum value of assets a person can have before their pension is affected Service or Age Pension Homeowner $ 321,500.00 $ 481,500.00 Non-homeowner $ 579,500.00 $ 739,500.00 Income Support Supplement* Homeowner $ 584,000.00 $ 820,500.00 Non-homeowner $ 842,000.00 $ 1,078,500.00 Deeming threshold $ 64,200.00 $ 106,200.00 MRCA rates New Rate (Weekly) Maximum Permanent Impairment amount $ 431.84 Maximum rate of Household Services $ 611.46 Maximum rate of Attendant Care $ 611.46 Dependent eligible young person $ 184.90 DRCA rates New Rate (Lump Sum) Maximum lump sum permanent impairment $ 323,722.77 New Rate (Weekly) Maximum household services $ 588.55 Maximum attendant care service $ 588.55 Death dependent child $ 182.68 *Different limits apply if assessed under transitional rules.\n\n**80th anniversary of the Battle of Balikpapan**\nOn this day in 1945, thousands of Australian troops landed on the beaches around the town of Balikpapan in south-east Borneo. Known as Oboe 2, this was the last and largest of the 3 operations that sought to liberate Japanese-held Borneo. Balikpapanâ€™s oil refineries and airfields were seen as important for future campaigns. The landing and battle at Balikpapan, along with those at Tarakan and Brunei Bay, proved successful, though strategically questionable. Balikpapan was the largest amphibious operation Australians undertook during the Second World War, and it was the last major battle they fought. Six weeks after it began, while troops were carrying out mopping-up operations around Balikpapan and elsewhere in Borneo, the Pacific War ended. Designated collectively as Operation Oboe, the 3 amphibious assaults took place between 1 May and 21 July. It was conducted against Imperial Japanese forces who had been occupying Borneo since early 1942. The Australian ground troops were supported by Australian, US, and other Allied air and naval forces, with the Americans providing the bulk of the shipping and logistical support. The initial plan was to secure vital airfields and port facilities to support future operations. However, the preparatory bombardments resulted in heavy damage to Borneoâ€™s infrastructure, including its oil production facilities. As a result, the strategic benefits that the Allies gained from the campaign were negligible."
